Previously known as a chamber pop group, Song Sparrow Research now weave
electronic textures and lock-step beats into their lush orchestrations and
sweeping guitar lines. The resulting music has a near-tidal qualityâ€”details
rise to the surface and crest before sinking back into the current of texture
and harmony underneath.
