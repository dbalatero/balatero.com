"Only Ghost" comes to you in three parts.

Part one is a frenetic pop song. Manic vocals plead you to stay grounded and to
not despair. Hyperactive drums, bass, and chord stabs underscore this
impassioned unrest. Tension and energy build and explode into the quiet
ambience of part two.

The wild begging of part one has become reserved regret. Vocal ghosts float
above drum machines and synthesizers. Warmth envelopes you. A sudden crescendo
leads you to a brick wall of distorted underground dance rhythms. The wall
crumbles, revealing part three.

You can only relax for a moment before a thundering drum solo begins, taking
you even farther away. Cosmic textures take over as the drums fade, leaving you
both satisfied and stunned.
