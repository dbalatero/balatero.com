As 2016 draws to a close, we're closing out our singles project with "Concrete
Heat," a cruiser of a dance track that celebrates the warehouse spaces and DIY
communities that have expanded our minds, enlarged our hearts, and welcomed us
time and time again. Thank you all so much for joining us this year! We hope
you continue to support independent music communities for years to come.
