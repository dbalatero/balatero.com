SGF is back with "Funky Adventure," a sparkly, infectious summer dance-pop jam!
With the fun months ahead (at least in the northern hemisphere), why live in
the past? "Funky Adventure" celebrates new lovers not wanting "before" to color
their experiences together. Brash sax, a bevy of synths, funky slap bass, and a
heavy shuffle complete an irreverent party vibe. The sequel to SGF's "Skin Is
Raw," "Funky Adventure" beseeches you to just let it all go. It dares you to
wear a big smile on your face. Have a great time!!!
