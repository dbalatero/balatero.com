Operation ID is Seattle’s (the world’s?) only minimalistic, avant-garde,
electro-pop, noise-cluster, synth-rock, free-jazz, experimental, dance-prog
band. Originally interested in the spontaneity of free-jazz, Operation ID’s
open mindedness has guided them to embrace a position of willingness when
experimenting with new sounds and musical approaches. They have grown from
being exclusively instrumental to frequently incorporating group vocals. Some
well known influences include Steve Reich, Talk Talk, Hella, Prince, XTC,
Richie Hawtin, and Deerhoof.
