This band is a great intersection of computers and music for me. We try create
sound not only with real instruments, but computer programs that we write. In
addition to one of our main instruments being a custom, light-based video
synthesizer, we also create sound by decoding network packets into sound and
teaching computers to mumble and speak lyrics via machine learning.
