Cycles Per Instruction combines free improvised performance with software
programs that the band wrote to create sound in novel ways. When all is said
and done, the computer ends up being a 4th improvising member of the band, fed
by data and expressing sound via algorithms.

We were written up on Hacker News, Reddit, Slashdot, Boing Boing, and countless
independent publications for releasing our album <em>Cycles Per
Instruction</em> as [a Linux kernel
module](https://github.com/usrbinnc/netcat-cpi-kernel-module).
